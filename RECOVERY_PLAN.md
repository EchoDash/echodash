Recovery Plan & Self-Critique

  Critical Issues Identified

  Current vs Mockup Gaps:

  1. Integration List - Current implementation uses generic card grid, mockup shows clean list with "Manage" and "Add Trigger" buttons
  2. Welcome Section Missing - Mockup has welcome text with video and endpoint configuration, current has none
  3. Integration Icons - Using dashicons instead of actual integration logos
  4. Trigger Modal - Completely wrong structure, missing key/value payload fields from mockup
  5. API Failures - REST routes returning 404, breaking data flow

  Where I Failed (Brutal Honesty)

  1. Assumptions Without Verification
  - Assumed React Router was needed without checking existing routing
  - Created complex App.tsx that couldn't integrate with WordPress admin
  - Didn't verify REST API endpoints before building frontend

  2. Missing Key Details
  - Ignored that mockups show a specific table-like list structure
  - Missed the payload key/value pairs in trigger modal
  - Didn't notice "Send Test" checkbox in modal

  3. Solutions That Don't Scale
  - Created SimpleApp as workaround instead of fixing root cause
  - Hardcoded styles instead of using consistent design system
  - No proper state management for complex interactions

  4. Architecture Mistakes
  - Tried to build SPA inside WordPress admin (wrong approach)
  - Didn't leverage WordPress's existing UI components properly
  - Created overly complex component hierarchy

  Corrected Recovery Plan

  Phase 1: Fix Foundation (Priority: Critical)
  1. Fix REST API endpoints in class-echodash-rest-api.php
  2. Ensure data flow from PHP to React works correctly
  3. Set up proper routing without React Router (use state-based views)

  Phase 2: Match Mockup Exactly
  1. Replace card grid with proper list table matching mockup
  2. Add welcome section with video placeholder
  3. Fix integration detail breadcrumb navigation
  4. Rebuild trigger modal with exact fields from mockup

  Phase 3: Implement Functionality
  1. Wire up trigger creation/editing
  2. Add "Send Test" functionality
  3. Implement trigger list with edit/delete actions

  Phase 4: Visual Testing
  1. Use Playwright for screenshot comparison
  2. Validate each view matches mockups
  3. Test complete user flow
