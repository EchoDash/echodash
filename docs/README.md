## Key Concepts

### Event Tracking Flow
1. WordPress action fires â†’ Integration method called
2. Integration calls `track_event($trigger, $objects)`
3. System retrieves configured events for trigger
4. Data collected using `get_{type}_vars` methods
5. Merge tags like `{user:email}` replaced with actual values
6. Events sent to EchoDash platform

### Integration System
- **Automatic Loading**: Integrations load when dependency plugins are detected
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add support for new plugins
- **Consistent API**: All integrations follow the same patterns
- **Flexible Configuration**: Global and post-specific event settings

### Merge Tag System
Dynamic data insertion using `{object_type:field_name}` format:
- `{user:user_email}` - Current user's email
- `{order:total}` - WooCommerce order total
- `{product:title}` - Product name
- Custom objects defined by integrations
